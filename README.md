        ```json
        {
        "quiz-list": {
            "{hostId}": {
            "{quizId}": {
                "quizId": "...",
                "quizTitle": "...",
                "questions": [
                {
                    "questionText": "...",
                    "options": ["...", "...", ...]
                }
                ]

            "quizId": "...",
            "state": "waiting|displayQuestion|revealAnswer|showLeaderBoard|ended",
            "currentQuestion": 0,
            "players": {
                "{playerId}": {
